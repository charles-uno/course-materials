# Tech Industry Concepts

This is a concept for a class. It does not exist yet. Not sure if it ever will. The idea is:

- School focuses mostly on individual achievement, but most "real" software is written by teams. Prepare students to work productively as part of a team.
- The tech industry has made huge process improvements in recent decades. Pipelines vs manual deployments, agile vs waterfall, test-driven development. Expose students to these ideas and set them up to be a part of in ongoing forward movement.

# Course Structure

The course will be run as one big project. Students will work together as a development team to create, maintain, and improve a web app. Ideal enrollment is 3-10 students. 

Students will begin by getting a proof-of-comcept app up and running. Likely a browser-based game hosted on a CS lab machine. Over the course of the semester they will roll out incremental improvements to the app, such as new features, UI improvements, automation, and/or telemetry.

This project will require significant collaboration between students. They will have to divide work across the team, review each others' code changes, and navigate merge conflicts. A significant portion of the course grade will be based on peer reviews.

# Potential Topics 

## Working as a Team

- Code reviews. Coding conventions. Style guides. Merge conflicts.
- Agile workflow. Standups. Self-organizing teams. Resilience to changing priorities. Asking for help.
- Peer feedback. Keeping notes that make it easy to brag about yourself and others. Giving constructive feedback.

## Testing and Deployment

- Concept: you own the quality of your work. 
- Technical debt. When to take it on, and when to pay it down.
- Unit tests, integration tests, mocks.
- Automated testing on commit. Likely implemented via GitHub Actions.
- Automated deployment. Blue/Green deployment.

## Metrics and Alerting

- Forms of telemetry: counters, timers, structured logs (eg stack traces). 
- Bug reports.
- Privacy concerns. Collecting and retaining user data. 
- Dashboards and alerts.

## System Design

## infrastructure as code

containers. docker

## Feature Flags

- AKA killswitches.

how long to work on something before asking for help? what is important for people to be able to find what they need within that much time?
