# Working as a team

Schoolwork often focuses on individual performance. But most "real" code is written by teams.

- code reviews. Style guides. 
- agile/scrum. Standups. Frequent iteration, feedback, retrospect. Self-organizing teams
- peer reviews. Keep notes that make it easy to brag about yourself. And notes that make it easy to brag about others! Big wins, tricky problems, who helped who on what 

# Pipelines 

- Test automation. Owning the quality of your own code
- deploy on commit
- blue/green deployment 

# telemetry

- counters, timers, structured loggers
- dashboards
- alerts


# system design

# everything has a URL

# feature flags / kill switches



run the class as one big project? example: tic-tac-toe app. probably want browser for faster iteration, one less thing to worry about

first get a tiny proof of concept up and running. then incremental updates. focus on being in a good place at the end of each week, then re-evaluate priorities
