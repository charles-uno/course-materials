\begin{frame}{Course Overview}

	Computers feel like magic. You type words. The machine does complex things. Especially in the era of large language models

	But it's not magic. Computers are made of semiconductors, metal, and magnets. Three different kinds of rocks

	This course is about demystifying the machine and exploring how, fundamentally, computers do what they do. Specifically, we'll be looking at:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The fundamental components of a computer
		\item How data is stored on a computer
		\item Building electrical circuits to perform logic
		\item Programming in Assembly (a very low-level language)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\Subsection{Grading}

\begin{frame}{Course Grade Breakdown}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Tests: 45\%
		\item Assignments: 45\%
		\item Participation: 10\%
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Tests}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There are eight standards in the class. Each is weighted equally
		\item There are four quizzes. Each quiz covers two standards
		\item The final covers all eight standards
		\item You only have to demonstrate proficiency once
		\item If you demonstrate proficiency on the quiz, you're good. Full credit. You can skip that part of the final
		\item If you demonstrate profociency on the final, full credit, regardless of your grade on the quiz
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assignments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item One assignment per standard. Each weighted equally
		\item Assignment prompts are on Doenet
		\item Some work will be graded automatically by Doenet
		\item Some work you will submit as a PDF on Moodle
		\item Coding assignments will be submitted via csgit
		\item Please work together in small groups
		\item Please ensure that the work you turn in reflects your own understanding
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Peer Reviews}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Participation score (10\% of your total grade) is mostly based on peer reviews
		\item Reviews will be short. Less than one page. They should include \emph{specific examples} of ways your peers helped you succeed
		\item You can get full credit here without too much trouble. Show up. Work together. Make it easy for your peers to write nice things about you
		\item I recommend keeping notes over the course of the semester when someone is particularly helpful, insightful, etc
	\end{itemize}
