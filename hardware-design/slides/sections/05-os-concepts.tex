\Section{OS Concepts}

% what is the OS?

% OS kernel

% device interface - allows devices to talk to the kernel

% system call interface - OS allows users to talk to the kernel

% running a program

% Booting
% boot block. often address 0x00000000
% firmware. non-volatile memory

% interrupts
% computer is idle until an interrupt wakes it up
% example system calls
% File I/O: open, read, write, close
% Process Management: fork, execve, exit
% Memory Management: mmap
% Networking: socket, connect, send, recv

% traps. another word for interrupt? comes from the opposite direction?

% bash system calls
% c system calls

% execution modes. user mode, kernel mode
% address space (OS is mapped into every space)

% meltdown attack

% multiprogramming. switching back and forth fast
% processes
% context switching

% process hierarchy. fork, child, parent

% multicore processors
% GPUs - fewer transistors, simpler instruction set
% memory wall - can't keep up with CPU speed increases
% power wall - can't dissipate heat fast enough
% threads. running on different cores, same memory
% wall time vs CPU time
