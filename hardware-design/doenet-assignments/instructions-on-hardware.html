    <p>This section of the lab is an exploration of the Raspberry Pi hardware.</p>
  
  <p>Open the black case to look at your Raspberry Pi. It should look similar to the picture below.</p>

  <p>Note that heat sinks have been attached to the CPU, RAM and USB controller. The CPU has millions of transistors being driven at billions of operations per second, and funneling sufficient electrical power into such a small package generates significant heat. The heat sinks passively dissipate this heat, keeping the CPU chip from getting too hot and damaging its circuitry or losing efficiency. </p>
  
  <p>Before the heat sinks were attached, your Raspberry Pi looked like the next image.</p>

    <p>In the diagram below, several Raspberry Pi components are labeled for you to identify. As you identify these components, you are welcome to use Google to search for information on your Raspberry Pi. Searching “Raspberry Pi 4 Components” should give you a good start.</p>
