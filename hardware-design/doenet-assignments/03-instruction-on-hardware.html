        <title>Identifying Raspberry Pi Components</title>
        <p>Open the black case to look at your Raspberry Pi. It should look similar to the picture below.</p>
        <image source='doenet:cid=bafkreib4xbnmaf5hxjfvqb6sejwev6umxj227iomzc6jzwwcn7btevdyky'

            mimeType='image/jpeg' />
        <p>Note that heat sinks have been attached to the CPU, RAM and USB controller. The CPU has millions of
            transistors
            being driven at billions of operations per second, and funneling sufficient electrical power into such a
            small
            package generates significant heat. The heat sinks passively dissipate this heat, keeping the CPU chip from
            getting too hot and damaging its circuitry or losing efficiency. </p>
        <p>Before the heat sinks were attached, your Raspberry Pi looked like the next image.</p>

            mimeType='image/jpeg' />
        <p>In the diagram below, several Raspberry Pi components are labeled for you to identify. As you identify these
            components, you are welcome to use Google to search for information on your Raspberry Pi. Searching
            “Raspberry
            Pi 4 Components” should give you a good start.</p>

        <p>Read Section 5.8 from the course textbook, <ref uri="https://diveintosystems.org/book/index.html">Dive Into
                Systems</ref>. Take notes as
            you read through these sections. After completing the reading, write a summary below. This summary will be
            graded manually. Note: this
            part may be done before, after, and/or during your work on the exercises below. <alert>Don't worry about the
                fifth execution stage (M)! FDEW is good enough for

        <title>Textbook Cache Test</title>

        <p>In this exercise we'll be comparing two programs performing math on 2D arrays. These are very similar to the
            example code in textbook chapter 11.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Look at the code for v1 and v2. Based on what you've learned about caching, which do you expect to run
                faster? Why? Put your response in <c>discussion.md</c>
            </li>
            <li>Compile v1: <c>gcc cache_test_v1.c -o cache_test_v1</c>
            </li>
            <li>Run it using a matrix with size 10k x 10k: <c>./cache_test_v1 10000</c>
            </li>
            <li>Add the output to <c>discussion.md</c>. Make sure to label it clearly</li>
            <li>Do the same for v2</li>
            <li>Do your results match your expectation? Discuss</li>

        <title>Install Valgrind</title>

        <p>
            <ref uri="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html">Valgrind</ref> is a tool for cache and memory
            analysis. Developers use it to find inefficiencies in their code
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Log into your Pi and navigate to the directory for this assignment</li>
            <li>Check your internet connection: <c>ping google.com</c> (then ctrl-C to kill it)</li>
            <li>Move to your home directory: <c>cd ~</c> (we don't want to upload valgrind to csgit)</li>
            <li>Download the source: <c>wget https://sourceware.org/pub/valgrind/valgrind-3.24.0.tar.bz2</c>
            </li>
            <li>Decompress the source files: <c>tar xvf valgrind-3.24.0.tar.bz2</c>
            </li>
            <li>Navigate into the new valgrind directory (hint: use <c>ls</c> to figure out the name)</li>
            <li>Configure valgrind: <c>./configure</c>
            </li>
            <li>Compile valgrind: <c>make</c> Note: this may take 10+ minutes! Take a break. Move your body. Drink some
                water.
            </li>
            <li>Install valgrind: <c>sudo make install</c>
            </li>
            <li>Navigate back to your assignment directory</li>
            <li>Confirm that valgrind is installed: <c>valgrind --version</c>
            </li>
            <li>Copy-paste the response into <c>discussion.md</c>

        <title>Cache Analysis with Valgrind</title>
        <p>Now, you'll use valgrind to simulate the cache for each version of your matrix functions from above.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perform a cache analysis on v1. Put it in your discussion. Make sure to label it clearly.
                <pre>valgrind --tool=cachegrind --cache-sim=yes ./cache_test_v1 1000</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Do the same for v2</li>
            <li>How many data cache reads are performed by v1? By v2? How do they compare? Add this to your discussion.
                Hint: check textbook section 11.5.2 for help interpreting the output</li>
            <li>How many D1 cache read misses occur for v1 and v2? How do they compare?</li>
            <li>How many LL cache misses?</li>
            <li>How do cache misses relate to the runtime of each? Does this match your explanations? Discuss</li>
