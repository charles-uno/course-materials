# Data Representation

### How do computers store information?

Computers work using electrical signals which can be on or off. If we let:

- On means 1
- Off means 0

	We can use sequences of 0s and 1s to represent information

### Numbers in Base Ten (aka Decimal)

Let's start by talking about how we write numbers normally.

For example, let's look at the number 109:
\begin{align*}
    109 & = 100 \;+\; 0 \;+\; 9                                   \\
        & = 1 \Times 10^2 \;+\; 0 \Times 10^1 \;+\; 9 \Times 10^0
\end{align*}
This way of writing numbers is called base ten.
We use ten digits (0 to 9 inclusive) and each position in the number is scaled by a power of ten.

In terms of math, there is nothing special about base ten. We probably use it
because we have ten fingers. Some ancient civilizations used sompletely
different systems for counting!
