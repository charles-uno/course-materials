### Course Overview

Computers feel like magic. You type words. The machine does complex things. Especially in the era of large language models

But it's not magic. Computers are made of semiconductors, metal, and magnets. Three different kinds of rocks

This course is about demystifying the machine and exploring how, fundamentally, computers do what they do. Specifically, we'll be looking at:

- The fundamental components of a computer
- How data is stored on a computer
- Building electrical circuits to perform logic
- Programming in Assembly (a very low-level language)

## Grading

### Course Grade Breakdown

- Tests: 45\%
- Assignments: 45\%
- Participation: 10\%

### Tests

- There are eight standards in the class. Each is weighted equally
- There are four quizzes. Each quiz covers two standards
- The final covers all eight standards
- You only have to demonstrate proficiency once
- If you demonstrate proficiency on the quiz, you're good. Full credit. You can skip that part of the final
- If you demonstrate profociency on the final, full credit, regardless of your grade on the quiz

### Assignments

- One assignment per standard. Each weighted equally
- Assignment prompts are on Doenet
- Some work will be graded automatically by Doenet
- Some work you will submit as a PDF on Moodle
- Coding assignments will be submitted via csgit
- Please work together in small groups
- Please ensure that the work you turn in reflects your own understanding

### Peer Reviews

- Participation score (10\% of your total grade) is mostly based on peer reviews
- Reviews will be short. Less than one page. They should include \emph{specific examples} of ways your peers helped you succeed
- You can get full credit here without too much trouble. Show up. Work together. Make it easy for your peers to write nice things about you
- I recommend keeping notes over the course of the semester when someone is particularly helpful, insightful, etc
