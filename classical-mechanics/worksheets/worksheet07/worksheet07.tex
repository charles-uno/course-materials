A ball rolls without slipping down a ramp of angle $\theta$. The ramp is fixed. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a picture!
\item Write down the Lagrangian for this system in terms of $x$ (the position of the ball) and $\phi$ (the ball's rotation). Recall that the rotational kinetic energy of a sphere is:
$$
T_{rot} = \tfrac{1}{2} I \dot{\phi}^2
\quad\quad\text{where $I=\tfrac{2}{5}mr^2$ for a sphere rotating around its center}
$$
\item What is the relationship between $x$ and $\phi$ for the ball to roll without slipping?

Hint: constraints should take the form $g(x, \phi) = \text{const}$
\item Use the Euler-Lagrange equation with a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to get the equations of motion for the system.
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} + \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}}
\quad\quad\text{and likewise for $\phi$}
$$
\item Use your equations of motion and your constraint to solve for $\ddot{x}$. How does it compare to the acceleration of a block sliding down a frictionless ramp? 
\item What is the value of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$? What is its physical significance?

\end{enumerate}
