VPython labs can be completed locally or on [webvpython.org](https://www.glowscript.org). To run on GlowScript, you must add `GlowScript 3.0 VPython` to the top of the file.

Materials here are those I created. Gaps generally reflect content created by [Prabal Adhikari](https://www.stolaf.edu/profile/adhika1), who was teaching the other section of the class at the same time.
